## Libs and tools

To develop a Electron app, you probably will need some UI, test, formatter, style or other kind of library or framework, so let me install and configure some of them to you.

### Core 🏍️

- [Electron 39](https://www.electronjs.org)
- [Vite 7](https://vitejs.dev)

### DX 🛠️

- [TypeScript 5.9](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [ESLint 9](https://eslint.org)
- [Zod 4](https://zod.dev)
- [React Query (TanStack)](https://react-query.tanstack.com)

### UI 🎨

- [React 19.2](https://reactjs.org)
- [Tailwind 4](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) as default font
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) (with file based routing)
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)

### Test 🧪

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

### Packing and distribution 📦

- [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io)

### CI/CD 🚀

- Pre-configured [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/LuanRoger/electron-shadcn/blob/main/.github/workflows/playwright.yml), for test with Playwright

### Project preferences 🎯

- Use Context isolation
- [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) is enabled by default.
- `titleBarStyle`: hidden (Using custom title bar)
- Geist as default font
- Some default styles was applied, check the [`styles`](https://github.com/LuanRoger/electron-shadcn/tree/main/src/styles) directory
- React DevTools are installed by default

## Directory structure

```plaintext
src/
├── actions
├── assets
├── components/
│   └── ui
├── constants
├── ipc/
│   ├── theme
│   └── window
├── layouts
├── localization
├── routes
├── styles
├── tests
├── types
└── utils
```

### Main directories

Here is a brief description of the main directories:

- `src/`: Main directory
  - `actions`: Functions that will call IPC functions via oRPC (it's mostly act as a bridge between the renderer process and the main process)
  - `assets/`: Assets like images, fonts, etc.
  - `components/`: UI components
    - `ui/`: Stores shadcn-ui components (this is the default directory used by shadcn-ui)
  - `ipc/`: Stores the configuration of the IPC communication using [oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com) for type-safety communication. Also have the handlers for the main process.
  - `layout/`: Layouts for the pages
  - `localization/`: i18next configuration and translation files.
  - `routes/`: TanStack Router's root configuration, route definitions and pages.
  - `style/`: Global styles
  - `tests/`: Stores tests (from Vitest and Playwright)

## NPM script

To run any of those scripts:

```bash
npm run <script>
```

- `start`: Start the app in development mode
- `package`: Package your application into a platform-specific executable bundle and put the result in a folder.
- `make`: Generate platform-specific distributables (e.g. .exe, .dmg, etc) of your application for distribution.
- `publish`: Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates.
- `lint`: Run ESLint to lint the code
- `format`: Run Prettier to check the code (it doesn't change the code)
- `format:write`: Run Prettier to format the code
- `test`: Run the default unit-test script (Vitest)
- `test:watch`: Run the default unit-test script in watch mode (Vitest)
- `test:unit`: Run the Vitest tests
- `test:e2e`: Run the Playwright tests
- `test:all`: Run all tests (Vitest and Playwright)

> The test scripts involving Playwright require the app be builded before running the tests. So, before run the tests, run the `package`, `make` or `publish` script.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuanRoger/electron-shadcn.git
```

Or use it as a template on GitHub

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```bash
npm run start
```

Now you can go directly to `/src/routes/index.tsx` and modify the app as you want.

> You can also delete the `/src/routes/second.tsx` file if you don't want a second page.
